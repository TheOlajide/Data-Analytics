2.Data loading into PowerBi
3.Transforming data in PowerBi
4.Handling missing values, error values, white or trailing spaces, incorrect column data types.
5.Data cleaning and formatting

### Recommendations
---
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are made:
- Netflix must always find a way to keep their business flourishing in the countries with high returns, so as not to lose customers.
- Different strategies should be deployed to build dominance in the lower performing countries. For example, contents appealing to the culture and tradition of the countries should be introduced on Netflix platform, language support systems and overall improved user experience.

 
### Limitations
---
It is pertinent to note that this exploration was not carried out using netflix original dataset, hence it does not reflect the realistic performance of the company.
